# Sample AI Setup Prompts

This directory contains example setup prompts generated by `vibeguard init --assist` for different project types.

## Available Samples

| File | Project Type | Tools Detected |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| [go-project.md](go-project.md) | Go | golangci-lint, goimports, go test |
| [node-project.md](node-project.md) | Node.js/TypeScript | ESLint, Prettier, Jest, TypeScript |
| [python-project.md](python-project.md) | Python | Black, isort, Ruff, mypy, pytest |

## Purpose

These samples demonstrate:

1. **Structure**: How the setup guide is organized with project analysis, recommendations, and examples
2. **Tool Detection**: What information is extracted about detected tools
3. **Check Recommendations**: How checks are suggested based on detected tools
4. **Language-Specific Examples**: Code examples tailored to each project type

## Using These Samples

### For Testing AI Agents

Copy a sample prompt and paste it into your AI coding agent to test configuration generation:

```bash
cat docs/sample-prompts/go-project.md | pbcopy  # macOS
```

### For Understanding the Format

Review these samples to understand what the `--assist` feature produces, helping you:

- Set expectations for what the AI agent will receive
- Understand how to customize the generated output
- Learn what checks are recommended for your project type

### For Development

When adding support for new project types or tools, create a corresponding sample prompt to document the expected output.

## Generating Your Own

To generate a setup prompt for your project:

```bash
vibeguard init --assist
```

The output will be similar to these samples but customized for your specific project's tools and structure.
