# CVE-2025-14104 Patch Status Monitoring

## Task Overview

Monitored upstream and Ubuntu Security advisories for patches to CVE-2025-14104, a Medium-severity vulnerability in util-linux affecting the setpwnam() function.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-2025-14104: util-linux setpwnam Heap Overread**

- **CVSS Score**: 6.1 (MEDIUM)
- **Vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H
- **Classification**: CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds Read)
- **Impact**: Heap buffer overread when processing 256-byte usernames in SUID login utilities (passwd, chfn, chsh)
- **Affected Component**: util-linux setpwnam() function with one-byte off-by-one read vulnerability

## Current Status

### Patch Availability
- **Ubuntu 24.04**: No official patches available yet
- **Ubuntu Security Portal**: CVE-2025-14104 not yet listed in active advisories
- **Debian**: Shows status as "postponed" or "no-dsa" in security tracker
- **Upstream**: Fixes exist in util-linux repository, but not backported to Ubuntu 24.04 yet

### Mitigation Strategy (Current)
As documented in the recent Docker hardening work (commit 258ba6c):

1. **Accepted Risk**: CVE-2025-14104 in util-linux remains in the Docker image
2. **Rationale**: util-linux is essential for system operations and cannot be removed
3. **Monitoring**: Image will be rebuilt monthly to pick up patches when available
4. **Alternative Bases Evaluated**: Alpine (higher vulnerability frequency), Debian 12 (more vulnerabilities), Distroless (no package manager for updates)

## Key Findings

1. **No immediate patches available** - Ubuntu Security team still evaluating fixes for early-2025 CVEs
2. **Not an actionable item yet** - Waiting for upstream releases and Ubuntu Security Advisory
3. **Mitigation in place** - Docker image already acknowledges the vulnerability and has documented acceptance
4. **Monthly rebuild strategy** - Dockerfile is in place to catch patches when released

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Next 30 days)
- Continue monitoring Ubuntu Security Advisories at https://ubuntu.com/security/notices
- Watch Debian security tracker for patches (upstream patches often appear here first)
- Keep subscription to Ubuntu security mailing list for CVE updates

### Medium-term (Next 3-6 months)
- Plan monthly Docker image rebuilds to pick up patches when released
- Consider implementing image vulnerability scanning in CI/CD (tracked in vibeguard-925)
- Document SLA for responding to Medium-severity vulnerability patches

### Long-term
- Implement distroless or scratch-based Docker approach once upstream packages are patched
- Transition to automated patch detection and image rebuild on CVE release
